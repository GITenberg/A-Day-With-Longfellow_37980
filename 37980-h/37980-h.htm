<h2><span class="wide">A DAY WITH LONGFELLOW</span></h2>

<p>The expression of serious and tender
thoughtfulness, which always characterized
the quiet face of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, had deepened during his later years,
into something akin to melancholy. The tragic
loss of his beloved wife,&mdash;burned to death while
she was sealing up in paper little locks of her
children's hair,&mdash;had left its permanent and
irrevocable mark upon his life. Still, he did not
seclude himself with his sorrow: the professor
of Modern Languages at Harvard could hardly do
that. He remained the selfsame kindly, gentle,
industrious man, welcoming with ready courtesy
the innumerable visitors to the Craigie House.</p>

<p>This is a large old-fashioned house in
Cambridge, Massachusetts&mdash;a place of grassy
terraces, long verandahs, lilac bushes, and shady
trees&mdash;a perfect dwelling for a man of cultured
tastes, as the interior also testifies.</p>

<p>From the Poet's study, a spacious, sunny
room upon the ground floor, he could look across
the meadows behind the house to the distant
silver windings of the River Charles. It was a
most orderly room. Every book and paper lay
where he could put his hand on it in a moment.
Book-cases full of valuable volumes&mdash;precious first
editions&mdash;busts and portraits,&mdash;were to be seen on
every side. A certain austere simplicity was
noticeable all over Longfellow's house. "His
private rooms," it has been said, "were like those
of a German professor." But the attractiveness
and delightfulness of Craigie House arose not from
any intrinsic opulence of its contents, but from the
personality of the man who lived there. "By his
mere presence he rendered the sunshine brighter,
and the place more radiant of kindness and peace."</p>

<p>The Poet began his day, so long as age and
health permitted, by a brisk morning walk. He
would be out and about by six, observing and
enjoying the beauty of earth and air, and subsequently
recording his exquisite impressions:</p>

<p>The morning's post brought the first consignment
of that enormous number of epistles which
were at once an affliction and an amusement to him.
The Poet was besieged by letters from ambitious
aspirants seeking advice, and from self-styled
failures, desirous of help. To these last he was
peculiarly drawn, for he was distinguished by "a
grace almost peculiar to himself at the time in
which he lived&mdash;his tenderness towards the
undeveloped artist, struggling towards individual
expression." In short, his first desire was to help
on people, and bring out the best in them.</p>

<p>Of apparent failure or success he recked little,
believing, like Stevenson, that the true success is
labour,&mdash;that pursuit, and not attainment is the
worthiest object of existence; and his philosophy
is summed up in the well-known words of <i>The
Ladder of Saint Augustine</i>,</p>

<p>Constant requests for autographs formed the
bulk of the day's budget, and these also never
went unanswered&mdash;even when couched in terms
the most <i>mal &agrave; propos</i>, much as those of the man
who said that "he loved poetry in 'most any
style,"&mdash;"and would you please copy your 'Break,
break, break' for the writer?" Possibly the worst
offenders, in this matter of autograph-hunting,
were those multitudinous schoolgirls of whom
Longfellow humorously complained that he was
always "kept busy answering." They ignored the
fact of his professional duties, and his own unremitting
work; anything to get a reply in the
handwriting of the celebrity! But he had a special
delight in budding womanhood, and had depicted
it with magical insight and rare delicacy of touch,
in lines which have never been excelled in their
charm and purity.</p>

<p>The early instalment of letters attended to,
the Poet could devote himself to his own affairs.
He believed in <i>working</i> at poetry, methodically,
systematically: although inspiration might flow
with sudden fervour, it was not to be waited for.
"Regular, proportioned, resolute, incessant industry,"
was the secret of his success, and the erasures
and substitutions in his MSS. bear witness to his
care in craftsmanship. The least conspicuous word
must be as perfect as he could make it. Longfellow's
creed, as expounded in <i>The Builders</i>, allowed for
no scamped work.</p>

<p>Not for long, however, might Longfellow
remain undisturbed in his sunny room. Sometimes
he welcomed the opening door that saw
"a little figure stealing gently in, laying an arm
round his neck as he bent over his work, and
softly whispering some childish secret in his ear."
For this was no obstacle to the current of his
tranquil thoughts. "My little girls are flitting
about my study," he wrote to a friend, "as blithe
as two birds. They are preparing to celebrate
the birthday of one of their dolls&hellip;. What a
beautiful world this child's world is! I take infinite
delight in seeing it go on all around me."</p>

<p>But these were congenial moments. There
were visitors much less desirable. "He was
besieged," as one of his friends declares, "by
every possible form of interruption which the
ingenuity of the human brain could devise." For
his admirers, whose name was legion, were not
satisfied with hero-worship afar off: they must
needs force themselves into his presence, and express
their admiration <i>viv&acirc;-voce</i>. Most amazing folks
swooped suddenly down upon him, ruthless and
unabashed.</p>

<p>Longfellow, always quick to see the comical
side of a situation, would tell with great delight
strange tales of his unexpected guests. "One
man," he said, "a perfect stranger, came with
an omnibus full of ladies. He introduced himself,
then returning to the omnibus, took out all the
ladies, one, two, three, four, five, with a little girl,
and brought them in. I entertained them to the
best of my ability, and they stayed an hour."</p>

<p>On another occasion, an English gentleman,
with no letter of introduction, abruptly introduced
himself, thus: "In other countries, you know, we
go to see ruins, and the like&mdash;but you have no
ruins in your country, and I thought," growing
embarrassed, "I would call and see <i>you</i>!" Another
strange gentleman accosted him with great fervour,
"Mr. Longfellow, I have long desired the honour
of knowing you. I am one of <i>the few men</i> who
have read your <i>Evangeline</i>!"</p>

<p>All these worshippers at his shrine were
received by the Poet with his unfailing courtesy
and patience; but he was invariably adroit in
warding off compliments. To applause and flattery
he was impervious&mdash;reference to his own works
was distasteful to him. His perfect modesty was
the reflex of his natural reticence.</p>

<p>Longfellow regarded life from the standpoint
of eternity, and thus was one who, in the words
of &agrave; Kempis, "careth little for the praise or
dispraise of men." His gaze was riveted upon
that "Land of the Hereafter," to which he was
always more than ready to set out, and in the
departure of Hiawatha he had imaged his longing
for the "Happiest Land."</p>

<p>Personal friends, of whom the Poet possessed
many, would arrive in time for lunch, and be
welcomed by the master of Craigie House at the
gate in the lilac hedge. He would bring them
into the large, cheerful dining-room, and the children
would sit at a little table on the verandah, while
the host, with his own hands, set the copper kettle
singing, and made tea in the antique silver pot.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful, happy hour for the guests.
Longfellow, unlike Tennyson, was never much of
a talker: he was a listener and observer, who
dwelt in a speaking silence&mdash;in what has been
defined as a heavenly unfathomableness. Ruskin
had written: "You come as such a <i>calm</i> influence
to me &hellip; you give me such a feeling of friendship
and repose." And this feeling was enhanced by
the man's natural dignity and grace, the refinement
of his features, the perfect taste of his dress, and
the exquisite simplicity of his manners. Many
have alluded to his soft, musical voice, to his
steady blue-grey eyes, to the "innate charm of
tranquillity," which gave a peculiar spiritual sweetness
to his smile. But the man was even more,
and better than the poet; so much so that a young
enthusiast exclaimed "All the vulgar and pretentious
people in the world ought to be sent to Mr.
Longfellow to show them how to behave!" Nor
was this calm the outcome of natural placidity&mdash;it
had been attained through bitter suffering: it
was that gleam of a hero's armour which the "red
planet Mars" unveils to a tear-dimmed sight,
when</p>

<p>After lunch, the guests would be taken round
the house, and its various treasures pointed out:
books in every corner, and on every wall pictures
and portraits; antique furniture, interesting
mementoes of every sort. It was a home well
worth seeing: and an old-world air pervaded all,
from the quaint drawing-room, with its old-fashioned,
rose-festooned wall-paper, to the upper
rooms with the Dutch-tiled hearths.</p>

<p>Later on, to those with whom he felt specially
<i>en rapport</i>, Longfellow would read aloud some
poems, new or old, his own, or those of other
men. He was not a forcible or a dramatic reader;
the simplicity which he loved "in all things," as
he had said, "but specially in poetry," was evident
also here. Yet perhaps no other man could have
done equal justice to the lingering hexameters of
his most successful poem&mdash;for such, by reason of
its novelty, pathos, and beauty, <i>Evangeline</i> must
always be considered. "It has become a purifying
portion," says Rossetti, "of the experiences of the
heart &hellip; a long-drawn sweetness and sadness";
and, though sixty years have elapsed since <i>Evangeline</i>
first appeared, the ideal maiden of this "idyll of
the heart" has lost no fraction of her loveliness.</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers.<br />
Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,<br />
Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!<br />
Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.<br />
When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noon-tide<br />
Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden.<br />
Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret<br />
Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop<br />
Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them,<br />
Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,<br />
Wearing her Norman cap, and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings,<br />
Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heir-loom,<br />
Handed down from mother to child, through long generations.<br />
But a celestial brightness&mdash;a more ethereal beauty&mdash;<br />
Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,<br />
Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.<br />
When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.<br />

<p>In the course of the afternoon, some of the
Poet's guests taking leave, others would accompany
him to a concert, organ recital, or any other
musical function which might be available.
Longfellow was passionately fond of good music,
and lost no opportunity of hearing it. His
own lyrics are singularly susceptible, as all
composers know, of an adequate musical setting.</p>

<p>After dinner, to which perhaps an intimate
friend or two remained, the poet would remain
awhile in his study: not actually at work, for his
writing was only done in the morning hours, but
considering and criticising work already accomplished,
and carefully perusing that great
translation of Dante which he considered, rightly
or wrongly, as the most important work of his
life. The twilight would slowly fade into the
dusk of a "blindman's holiday," and then came
the sweetest moment of the day.</p>

<p>Longfellow's intense affection for all little
ones, his touching kindness to them, his sympathy
with their most trivial joys or troubles, were
focussed and centred in the love he bore to his
own dear, motherless children.</p>

<p>A brief period of childish gaiety would
supervene, to which the man of childlike heart
responded readily; and when the little feet had
pattered bedward, and the house was silent from
the merry little voices, the father would sit on
until midnight in his spacious empty room. He
would occupy himself with letters&mdash;long, fragrant,
pleasant gossips to his best and most familiar
friends at a distance: till midnight came upon
him unawares. "It is nearly one o'clock&mdash;I am
the only person up in the house: my candle is
sinking in its socket."</p>

<p>And a double loneliness descended upon him
as his weary hand laid down the pen. He remained
inert and brooding; the solitude was almost
tangible. But this solitude was presently peopled
by visions, fraught with ineffable consolation to
a mind never out of touch with "other-worldly"
influences.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
